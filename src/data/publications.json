Our approach combines human-in-the-loop machine learning with explainable task routing to improve both efficiency and worker satisfaction. Through a large-scale deployment with 500+ crowd workers, we demonstrate significant improvements in task completion quality while maintaining transparency in algorithmic decision-making.",
